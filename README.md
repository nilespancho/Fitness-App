# Fitness-App

#### A fitness app that provide users information and instructions about exercises and physical activities. It also allows users to calculate their calorie deficit through the use of the calorie deficit calculator feature. Through this feature, the user is able to know how many calories are needed to intake in order to gain, maintain, or lose weight.

This was coded in Android Studio IDE using Kotlin. This was a group project and I was in charge of the calorie deficit calculator.
